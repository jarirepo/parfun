# parfun
Gives a general framework (based on the OOP-capabilities in MATLAB) to define a set of parameterized functions. 
It allows an arbitrary number of user-specified parameters to be associated with any number of user-defined functions. 
The associated functions within the function set is automatically evaluated and the result array updated whenever a 
parameter value is changed.

This is pretty much like changing a cell in MS Excel where we get an immediate response to the change in any of the input cells.
